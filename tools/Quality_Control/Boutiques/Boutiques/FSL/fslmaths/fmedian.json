Inputting -1 for a size will set it to the full image extent for that dimension.\n -bptf  <hp_sigma> <lp_sigma> : (-t in ip.c) Bandpass temporal filtering; nonlinear highpass and Gaussian linear lowpass (with sigmas in volumes, not seconds); set either sigma<0 to skip that filter\n -roc <AROC-thresh> <outfile> [4Dnoiseonly] <truth> : take (normally binary) truth and test current image in ROC analysis against truth. <AROC-thresh> is usually 0.05 and is limit of Area-under-ROC measure FP axis. <outfile> is a text file of the ROC curve (triplets of values: FP TP threshold). If the truth image contains negative voxels these get excluded from all calculations. If <AROC-thresh> is positive then the [4Dnoiseonly] option needs to be set, and the FP rate is determined from this noise-only data, and is set to be the fraction of timepoints where any FP (anywhere) is seen, as found in the noise-only 4d-dataset. This is then controlling the FWE rate. If <AROC-thresh> is negative the FP rate is calculated from the zero-value parts of the <truth> image, this time averaging voxelwise FP rate over all timepoints. In both cases the TP rate is the average fraction of truth=positive voxels correctly found.\n\nCombining 4D and 3D images:\n If you apply a Binary operation (one that takes the current image and a new image together), when one is 3D and the other is 4D,\n the 3D image is cloned temporally to match the temporal dimensions of the 4D image.\n\ne.g. fslmaths inputVolume -add inputVolume2 output_volume\n     fslmaths inputVolume -add 2.5 output_volume\n     fslmaths inputVolume -add 2.5 -mul inputVolume2 output_volume\n\n     fslmaths 4D_inputVolume -Tmean -mul -1 -add 4D_inputVolume demeaned_4D_inputVolume\n\n\n",
